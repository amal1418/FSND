# Full Stack API Udacity Final Project

## Full Stack Trivia

Trivia is an API project that created for Udacity because Udacity is invested in creating bonding experiences for its employees and students. A bunch of team members got the idea to hold trivia on a regular basis and created a  webpage to manage the trivia app and play the game, but their API experience is limited and still needs to be built out. 

That's where I come in! Help them finish the trivia app so they can start holding trivia and seeing who's the most knowledgeable of the bunch.
